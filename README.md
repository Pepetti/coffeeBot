# coffeeBot

!!This is a work in progress!!

The basic idea of the bot is this:
- The bot consists of a raspi and a digital kitchen scale
- A coffee pot is placed on the scale
- After this the user can send a message via telegram to the telegram bot running on the raspi to check how much coffee there is in the pot. (Function later to be added: check the temperature of the coffee, subscription system: user can subscribe to the bot to get notifications when the coffee is brewing / ready).
