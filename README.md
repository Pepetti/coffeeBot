# coffeeBot

!!This is a work in progress!!

The basic idea of the bot is this:
- The bot consists of a raspberry pi 3 and an arduino uno connected to a simple digital scale.
- A coffee pot is placed on the scale
- After this the user can send a message via telegram to the telegram bot running on the rasbperry pi 3 to check how much coffee there is in the pot. (Function later to be added: check the temperature of the coffee).

Full details of the setup and code will be added once the project progresses.
