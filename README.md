# coffeeBot

## The basic idea of the bot is this:
You place a coffee pot on a scale and leave it there (or if you have large enough scale place the whole machine on the scale, just calibrate it correctly). After this you can send the bot messages via Telegram app to see how much coffee there is in the pot. No need to, for example, move from your workstation to an empty coffee pot to feel the dissappointment.
